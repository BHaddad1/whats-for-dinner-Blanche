### Abstract:
This app finally answers the age-old question: What should I have for dinner? Just choose the dish you'd like inspiration for, and get your answer immediately!


### Installation Instructions:
To use this app, fork this repository, clone it down to your machine in a directory of your choosing, and run 'open index.html' in your Terminal.


### Preview of App:

 (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
(Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)

### Learning Goals:
The goals of this project was to learn how to work with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript together to manipulate the DOM.

### Wins + Challenges:
Some wins were writing the functionality in JS, and styling the DOM with CSS. Some challenges I faced were also styling the DOM in CSS, and I navigated that with loads of help from Professor Google, and some CSS/HTML experts in my Turing cohort.
